# Productivity Timer
>- A session based time manager application
> - You can get together with your colleagues and organize breaks
>  or work times


This webpage is rendered by [react](https://reactjs.org). 
With the help of websockets we can achieve synchronicity.


- User joins a sessions (that multiple users can also join)
- the Homepage prompts the user to enter a session name
- a session contains buttons to set work or break timers
- session stores how many blocks (study sessions) each user finished
- event reminder
- break reminder (for long periods)


# Database details

- events, no. of blocks ---> localStorage




# Future Ideas
- associate all data with users
